This gene encodes the fusion protein known as BCR-ABL, which plays an important role in the development of t(9;22) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Since then, many different leukemia fusion proteins have been discovered to function as the drivers of leukemias. One of these is AML1-ETO, arising from a recurring t(8;21) chromosomal translocation between chromosome 8 and chromosome 21. Its expression is responsible for up to 15% of all acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. While most AMLs tend to affect elderly patients, t(8;21) AML is common in the children and young adult patient population. AML1-ETO is the product of an in-frame fusion between the DNA-binding domain of the AML/RUNX1 gene and a nearly full-length ETO/MTG8/RUNX1T1 protein, missing a small N-terminus. At the DNA level, the fusion event occurs between intron 1 of ETO (Figure 1) and intron 3 of RUNX1 (Figure 2).\nFigure 1: Expression of exon 9a in an t(8;21) AML detected by RNA-Seq and location of the t(8;21) translocation site\n Figure 2: The marked sequence and its upstream region are translocated into the ETO gene in t(8;21) AML\n 12 exons have been annotated in the human reference genome for the ETO gene. Dr. Dong-Er Zhang found that an unannotated exon is transcribed to produce an alternative splice variant from the AML1-ETO fusion gene. This exon was subsequently called exon 9a and the corresponding AML1-ETO variant was named AML1-ETO9a (Yan, M., Kanbe, E., Peterson, L. et al. A previously unidentified alternatively spliced isoform of t(8;21) transcript promotes leukemogenesis. Nat Med 12, 945-949 (2006)). While full-length AML1-ETO has 752 amino acids, AML1-ETO9a has only 542 amino acids. This is because if exon 9a is retained after splicing, it would introduce a premature stop codon.\nAML1-ETO9a lacks a C-terminal sequence present in the full-length protein. This region interacts with proteins that play a role in transcriptional repression. It is still controversial whether AML1-ETO9a plays a role in disease progression in t(8;21) AML. To address this question, several groups have compared patients with high or low levels of AML1-ETO9a at diagnosis. Early studies showed that AML1-ETO9a expression was associated with poor prognosis. However, recent work by Agrawal M et al challenged this view by showing that the level of AML1-ETO9a was not correlated with prognosis in an independent cohort of t(8;21) AML patients (Functional and clinical characterization of the alternatively spliced isoform AML1-ETO9a in adult patients with translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Leukemia. 2020 Feb;34(2):630-634).\nAlthough AML1-ETO expression at diagnosis may not be a prognostic factor, its levels may increase after treatment to promote disease progression. In this case, we would expect AML1-ETO9a expression to be increased in relapsed AML.\nThe goal of this study is to develop an algorithm to detect the fusion genes using RNA-Seq data and quantify the expression of their isoforms. For the above reasons, we focused on the AML1-ETO isoforms.\nMETHODS We used the Kallisto software to quantify the fusion transcript levels. Kallisto quantifies the expression of a given transcript by aligning the reads to a transcriptomic index created from the sequences of all expressed transcripts in a genome. Because fusion gene transcripts are not included in the reference genome, in order to detect and quantify them, we created a custom index wherein we replaced the canonical ETO/RUNX1T1 isoforms with the sequences of FL AML1-ETO and the truncated AML1-ETO9a isoform. The RNA-Seq data of patient samples were downloaded from the NCI TARGET AML database.\nRESULTS Expression of AML1-ETO9a is detected in all AMLs with known t(8;21) status and some AMLs with unknown or negative t(8;21) status. Figure 3: Expression of AML1-ETO FL and AML1-ETO9a\n As shown in Figure 3, we detected AML1-ETO9a in all t(8;21) AMLs previously annotated using conventional cytogenetics approaches such as FISH. Interestingly, we also detected AML1-ETO9a expression in AMLs with “unknown” or negative t(8;21) statuses. One possibility is that the conventional assays were not sensitive enough to detect the presence of the fusion event.\nDetection of AML1-ETO fusion transcripts by STAR-fusion and Kallisto-fusion tools. Some bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to detect fusion genes from RNA-Seq data. We tested two such algorithms, known as STAR-fusion and Kallisto-fusion. Both algorithms found that the two AMLs with an “unknown” t(8;21) status but expressing high levels of AML1-ETO9a indeed had fusion between AML1 and ETO (Figures 4,5). Consistent with our results, the Kallisto- fusion found that several AMLs with negative t(8;21) status but expressing detectable levels of AML1-ETO also contained AML1-ETO fusion transcripts (Figure 5).\nFigure 4: Detection of AML1-ETO fusion by STAR-Fusion\n Figure 5: Detection of AML1-ETO fusion by Kallisto-Fusion\n AML1-ETO9a expression at the time of diagnosis was not correlated with disease progression (Figure 6). Figure 6: AML1-ETO9a levels at diagnosis cannot predict patient outcome\n AML1-ETO9a levels are significantly elevated in t(8;21) AML in relapse. Since we have now determined AML1-ETO9a levels at both diagnosis and relapse, we wanted to know whether its expression changed significantly at relapse compared with diagnosis. This required the use of paired AMLs, for which 5 cases were available in the TARGET t(8;21) AML cohort.\nFigure 7: AML1-ETO9a is significantly increased at relape in t(8;21) AML\n The results showed that the expression of AML1-ETO9a significantly increased in t(8;21) AML at relapse (Figure 7). This suggests a role for AML1-ETO9a in promoting disease progression in t(8;21) AML.\nCONCLUSION FusionQuant is capable of simultaneously detecting and quantifying leukemia fusion gene isoforms in t(8;21) AML. AML1-ETO9a levels at the time of diagnosis do not correlate with survival. AML1-ETO9a levels are significantly increased in relapsed AMLs, suggesting a role for AML1-ETO9a in disease progression in t(8;21) AML.
